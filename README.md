# Coinduction in Dedukti/Lambdapi

This is a small library demonstrating how we can represent and use coinduction in Dedukti and Lambdapi. It shows how we can represent streams and formal languages coinductively, and reason about them using a coinductive form of equality.

The files in folders `dedukti` and `lambdapi` were generated automatically from the ones in `agda_(source)`, using the new feature in Agda2Dedukti which allows it to translate coinductive definitions and functions.
